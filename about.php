		<h2>About Neil</h2>
		<img src="/src/images/neilj.jpg">
		<p>I am a web developer who specializes in responsive and CMS development. My experience is primarily related to front end development but I am working on more PHP projects to strengthen my back end skills.
		</p>
		
		<p>I have a strong interest in new technologies and ways to improve the development process. I enjoy projects that challenge me to learn something new and push me beyond my confort zone. Currently, I am exploring deployment automation and Ruby on Rails.
